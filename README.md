## Wiki

- [What is Monitoring?](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/it-monitoring.html)

`Monitoring helps ensure a system is working correctly and allows proactive problem detection and resolution before they become critical. We can say, therefore, monitoring is a subset of telemetry. It provides deeper monitoring capabilities and a comprehensive understanding of the system.`
